/*
Mutating methods-
Methods which make changes in same array, without creating new ones.
Eg:-
.push() — Adds a new item as the last item of the array.
.pop() — Removes the last item of the array.
.unshift() — Adds a new item as the first item of the array.
.shift() — Removes the first item of the array.
.reverse() — Reverses the order of the array.
.splice() — Removes/replaces item(s) in the array.
.sort() — Re-orders the items in the array based on their Unicode code points.
.copyWithin() — Copies one part of the array and puts it on another part of the same array.
.fill() — Changes some or all items in the array into the value being passed in.

Non-Mutating-
Methods which returns new array as result.
Eg:-
.filter()-creates new array on the basis of given condition 
.find()-returns the first index of the given element that satisfies the condition
.map()-returns the new array by applying the various operation given to it.
